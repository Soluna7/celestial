# Celestial Calculations
## Overview
This is a dependency I am developing for the Analemma project to track the location of celestial objects in the sky over time at specific geographical coordinates.
## Limitations
The calculations do not have parameters for orbital eccentricity, and treat the planet of observation as a perfect sphere instead of an oblate spheroid (which would be more accurate for Earth).
